        <h3 class="faq-question">Why is event delegation useful?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          It improves performance, reduces memory usage, and simplifies code by avoiding multiple event listeners for
          similar elements.

        <h3 class="faq-question">How does event delegation work?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          It works because of event bubbling — when an event occurs on a child element, it bubbles up to its parent,
          allowing the parent to handle it.

      <div class="faq">
        <h3 class="faq-question">What is event bubbling?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Event bubbling is the process where an event starts from the target element and moves upward through its
          ancestors in the DOM.
